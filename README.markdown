CarrierWave-VIPS
======================

This adds support to CarrierWave for the ultrafast and resource efficient
VIPS library. It passes all of the rspec tests with the exception of one,
which is due to a change in the API of the ruby-vips gem. The confidence
level of this CWV is currently at 90%.  That being said, please verify the
output of this processor thoroughly before deploying to production.

A quick overview:
---------------------

See the instructions for CarrierWave to use this processor. You will need
to include the Vips module in the upload class:


    class AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
      include CarrierWave::Vips
    end

You can use the following methods to resize your images. All methods keep
aspect ratio:

* `resize_to_fill(x,y)` Will increase/decrease the size of the image and match the specified dimensions exactly, chopping off any extraneous bits.
* `resize_to_fit(x,y)` Will increase/decrease the size of the image to fit within the specified dimensions. One dimension may be less than specified.
* `resize_to_limit(x,y)` Just like resize_to_fit except will not increase size of image.
* `format("jpeg|png|gif")` Changes the format of the image
* `quality(0-100)` Sets the quality of the image being saved if JPEG
